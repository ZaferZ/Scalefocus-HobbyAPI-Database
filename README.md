# EVENTIT
## _The App that connects_



EVENTIT is an app that lets you create and explore events that people with similar hobbies will attend.

- Make and manage events, leave comments, connect with peopple
- Sellect your favourite activites, bookmark them and attend


## Features

- Make and event with a place, date and time 
- Make a to-do list with tasks that need to be done
- Select hobbies and connect with people that share interests with you
- Leave comments on events and browse for more

The project is made using a microservice approach where we devide the API to several micro-projects. Or model structure consists of the following entities such as:

 - User
 - Comment
 - Event
 - Hobby
 - Task

The person makes a profile using the User API then he is promted to sellect a hobby using the Hobby API. After that user can look at or crate events and chose to attend whichever events he has access to form the hobbies he has sellected. After someone chooses to attend and event they are prompted to the Evnet API where they can see all of the informataion of the event and see whatever tasks the owner of the event has requred to be done using the Task API. You can also make comments on the events and interact with people there using the Comments API.
